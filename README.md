# ArcPro_Python

Basically this repo is going to have a mix of geoproccessing in python, specifically in Arcpy for geospatial analysis. This will consists of different scripts, such as data managemnet, spatial analysis, raster analysis, and basic python functionality. 

My virtual env is a conda env with arc GIS Pro 2.7, using anoconda 3.7
